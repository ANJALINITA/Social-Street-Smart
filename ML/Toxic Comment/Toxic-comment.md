<h3>Toxic Comment/Hate Speech ML models: <h3>

- Data contains all input datasets

- Models contain ML models for Hate speech
    - It has two models - LSTM and CNN, LSTM gives better performance so is used here.

- Output has output files from ML model that can be used as input for Hate speech APIs


- Glove GB dataset - https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

    Download Glove GB files from above link and add to Toxic Comment/Data/glove.6B

- Toxic comment dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

    Download all the files from Toxic comment Data and add it to Toxic Comment/Data/toxic-comment 

- You will get output files
that is json, weights.h5 and pickle after training ML models in Output folder Toxic Comment/output
